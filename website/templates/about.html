      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Nexsights is a data and business consulting firm focused on helping
        startups and growing organizations use their data more effectively.
        We specialize in data analysis, business analysis, MIS reporting,
        dashboarding, automation, and AI-driven solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In today’s data-heavy world, many businesses collect information but
        struggle to turn it into clear, actionable insights. Nexsights bridges
        this gap by combining business understanding with strong analytical
        and technical expertise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work is driven by a simple principle — data should support real
        business decisions, not create confusion. Every solution we deliver
        is practical, scalable, and aligned with measurable outcomes.
      </p>

        SQL, and machine learning frameworks, the goal behind Nexsights is to
